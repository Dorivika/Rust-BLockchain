# A simple POW Blockchain in Rust (Kinda) 
This implementation is heavily inspired by https://github.com/tensor-programming implementatiton of blockchain in GO.

### This isn't a copy. 
I have added my own design choices to a lot of a things, one of them being, using a hashmap which is written to disk as my persistence layer for the blockchain.

### Some of the Key Features include Consensus Algorithm, Wallets, Database, Merkle Tree and many more. WIP so everything will get better.
